			<p>Welcome to Dianie.Me, a place where I share my passion for wildlife photography and my adventures in the heart of Sri Lanka’s most breathtaking national parks. I’m Dianie Gunathilaka, a wildlife photographer with a special love for capturing the elusive beauty of leopards in the wild.

				Most of my journeys take me to Wilpattu, Yala, and Kumana national parks rich with diverse wildlife and stunning landscapes.</p>
